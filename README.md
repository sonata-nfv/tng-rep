* [puma](http://puma.io/) - Web server
* [json](https://github.com/flori/json) - JSON specification
* [sinatra-contrib](https://github.com/sinatra/sinatra-contrib) - Sinatra extensions
* [rake](http://rake.rubyforge.org/) - Ruby build program with capabilities similar to make
* [JSON-schema](https://github.com/ruby-json-schema/json-schema) - JSON schema validator

### Contributing

You may contribute to the editor similar to other 5GTANGO (sub-) projects, i.e. by creating pull requests.

## Installation

After cloning the source code from the repository, you can run Catalogue-Repositories with the next command:

```sh
bundle install
```

Which will install all the gems needed to run, or if you have docker and docker-compose installed, you can run

```sh
docker-compose up
```

## Usage

The following shows how to start the API server for the Catalogues-Repositories:

```sh
rake start
```

or you can use docker-compose

```sh
docker-compose up
```

The Repositories' API allows the use of CRUD operations to send or retrieve records.
The available records include services records (NSR) and functions records (VNFR).
For testing the Repositories, you can use 'curl' tool to send a request to the API. It is required to set the HTTP header 'Content-type' field to 'application/json' or 'application/x-yaml' according to your desired format.
Remember to set the IP address and port accordingly.

Method GET:

To receive all instances you can use

```sh
 curl http://localhost:4012/records/nsr
```

```sh
 curl http://localhost:4012/records/vnfr
```

To receive an instance by its ID:

```sh
curl -X GET http://localhost:4012/records/nsr/9f18bc1b-b18d-483b-88da-a600e9255868
```

```sh
curl -X GET http://localhost:4012/records/vnfr/9f18bc1b-b18d-483b-88da-a600e9255016
```

Method POST:

To send a record instance

```sh
curl -X POST --data-binary @test_nsr.yaml -H "Content-type:application/x-yaml" http://localhost:4012/records/nsr
```

```sh
curl -X POST --data-binary @test_vnfr.yaml -H "Content-type:application/x-yaml" http://localhost:4012/records/vnfr
```
